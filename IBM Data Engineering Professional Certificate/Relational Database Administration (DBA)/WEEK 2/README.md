## ****Backup and Restore Databases****

- The types of backups are full, point-in-time, differential, and incremental.
- The difference between physical backups and logical backups, and between hot backups and cold backups.
- Your backup policy should be determined from your recovery needs and your data usage.
- Database transaction logs keep track of all activities that change the database structure and record transactions that insert, update, or delete data in the database.

## ****Security and User Management****

- Authentication is the process of verifying that the user is who they claim to be. Authorization is the process of giving users permissions or privileges to access the objects and data in the database.
- When securing a database, you need to consider the security of the server and operating system, as well as the database and data.
- A database user is a user account that is allowed to access specified database objects. Groups are logical groupings of users to simplify user management. A database role defines a set of permissions needed to undertake a specific role in the database.
- When implementing role or group membership, use the principle of least privilege.
- Auditing does not directly protect your database but does identify gaps in your security.
- Customer-managed keys provide the data owner with more control over their data stored in the cloud.
